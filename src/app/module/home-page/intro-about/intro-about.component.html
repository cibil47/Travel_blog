I’m a software developer by profession, but when I’m not coding, you’ll often find me exploring new corners of the world. Originally from India, my husband Cibil and I are currently based in Germany, where we are enjoying the European experience while continuing to satisfy our wanderlust.

                        Traveling is not just a hobby for me; it’s a way to discover diverse cultures, meet inspiring people, and find beauty in the unexpected. I’ve already had the pleasure of exploring places like China, Italy, and Romania, and my journey doesn’t stop there. I believe that every trip adds a new chapter to my life story, and through this blog, I hope to share my adventures, travel tips, and experiences with fellow explorers.
                        
                        Join me as I continue to discover the world one country at a time!</p>

            I'm Gladis Jesy, the guy behind this website. I'm an American who's been traveling the world full-time for 8 years now.<br>
            I started this travel blog in 2019 to document my own international trips, share my photos, and help others learn how to travel the world and find some really good spots off the beaten path.<br>
            All of the writing and pictures on this site come from my own personal experience.<br>
            I'm currently based in Bali, Indonesia, where I met my wife Intan, who’s a Bali local. Now she joins me on these adventures too.<br>
            Together, we've done some bucket list hikes, climbed active volcanoes, seen exotic wildlife, and visited some spectacular castles, temples, and monuments around the world.<br>
            I've worked with and been featured by BBC Travel, NBC News, Time, and other companies.<br>
            I haven’t been everywhere, but it’s on my list. I hope this world travel blog can help and inspire you in your own journeys as well!
